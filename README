Steps to Deploy on Vercel
Create a GitHub repository (if you haven't already) and push your project code there.

Sign in to Vercel and connect your GitHub repository.

Deploy the app: Vercel will automatically detect your project as a Node.js application.

Access the API: After deployment, you can access your joke API at something like:

https://your-project-name.vercel.app/api/jokes
